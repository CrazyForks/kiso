/**
 * 0.40.0 (the owner's dogfood) — one session folder per project.
 *
 * Every session used to live in one `KISO_HOME/sessions`, and a session of
 * one project could be resumed from another. Its file tools, rooted at the
 * cwd, then pointed at the wrong tree. A session now lives in the folder of
 * the project it runs in, `KISO_HOME/projects/<enc>/`, and another project's
 * session is not in this folder by construction.
 *
 *   <enc>           the workspace realpath, every non-alphanumeric turned
 *                   into `-` (a readable name, not an identity)
 *   workspace.json  the realpath the folder belongs to — the identity. A
 *                   folder naming another realpath is never adopted; the
 *                   newcomer's name takes a `-<sha8>` suffix instead
 *   _unknown/       legacy sessions whose project could not be read
 *
 * A session's PLACEMENT is derived, never written: in a project folder, a
 * session whose profile records a workspace is `recorded`, one without is
 * `inferred` (only the one-time migration puts it there); in `_unknown`, it
 * is `unknown`. The evidence behind an inference is in the migration's
 * manifest.
 *
 * `KISO_SESSIONS_DIR` pins the folder outright (tests, bench runners, a
 * delegated child writing beside its parent), and the reverse migration's
 * marker restores the single legacy folder. Either one turns this layout
 * off, and with it every cross-project rule below.
