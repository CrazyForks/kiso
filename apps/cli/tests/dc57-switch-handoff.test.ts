/**
 * DC-57 — the line that arrives WITH a switch command goes to the session
 * that was asked for (the owner's ruling, 2026-09-21: option ① queue it).
 *
 * A switch is not applied at the moment it is requested: `/resume <id>` sets
 * a pending target and `chat()` returns; the loop opens the new session
 * afterwards. One read can carry several lines — a paste, a pipe, a
 * scripted driver — and the DEPARTING instance used to dispatch the rest of
 * the batch, so the turn landed in the session the person was leaving (and
 * spent that session's context: the measured probe was a prompt answered by
 * `fresh` while the switch to `alpha` happened afterwards).
 *
 * The fix is the mechanism the pre-ready lines already use: once the session
 * is leaving, further lines are queued and replayed by the NEXT `chat()`
 * entry. This gate asserts it on the durable logs — which session's
 * `user_input` the line became — never on the screen.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY, pinned here so it is a decision rather than an accident, and
 * it has TWO refusals with two different answers:
 *   - the target does NOT list (a typo, or a sidecar that cannot be read and
 *     so is never offered) — the person never left, and the rest of the batch
 *     is theirs in the session they are in;
 *   - the target EXISTS and cannot be OPENED (an XP-era log with scoped
 *     continuation envelopes and no sidecar: the fail-closed integrity case) —
 *     here the line must NOT be answered by the session being left. It is held
 *     back and printed, so nothing vanishes in silence.
