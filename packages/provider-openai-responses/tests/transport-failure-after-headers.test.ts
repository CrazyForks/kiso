/**
 * The transport-failure-after-headers class (0.39.1).
 *
 * Once a 2xx and the headers are in, the request has been ACCEPTED: no
 * later failure is a verdict on whether it was valid. What is left is the
 * server or the transport failing mid-flight, and the kernel's bounded
 * mid-stream retry (ADR-0005, F4: void the draft durably, then retry, cap
 * `maxRetries`) is the right answer — not an error terminal the human has
 * to restart by hand.
 *
 * This adapter already treated ONE member of the class that way: a socket
 * that DIES mid-stream (`toTransportError`). Four siblings did not, and
 * reached the run as `unknown / retryable:false`:
 *  1. an in-stream `error` frame;
 *  2. a `response.failed` frame;
 *  3. a frame whose payload is not JSON;
 *  4. a stream that ENDS with no terminal frame at all.
 *
 * The controls below are the other half: a failure the provider states
 * BEFORE the stream (a 400), and a terminal the provider actually sent,
 * both stay exactly as non-retryable as they were. The class is "after
 * the headers, without a verdict" — not "anything that goes wrong".
