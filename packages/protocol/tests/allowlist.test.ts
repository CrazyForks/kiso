/**
 * The wire's classification is TOTAL over the durable union: every one of

 * row) or named off it. A new durable variant cannot reach a client by
 * default and cannot be forgotten either — this test goes red until it is
 * classified. The 27 names are pinned here as data on purpose: this
 * package imports nothing from the runtime.
