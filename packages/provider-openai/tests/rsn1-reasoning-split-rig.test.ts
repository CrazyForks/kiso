/**
 * RSN-1 — the thinking split comes off the wire, end to end.
 *
 * `canonical.reasoning` sat hardcoded null under a comment saying no
 * provider reports a split. That was true when written and had stopped
 * being true: the vendor reports `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`
 * in the SAME usage object we already read the cache figure out of.
 *
 * It is a SPLIT of the output, not a fifth quantity — completion tokens
 * have always included reasoning ones, so nothing was ever under-billed.
 * What was missing is which half the money went to, and that is the half
 * the effort knob moves.
 *
 * A rig, because the value has to survive FOUR hops — adapter, event,
 * guard, canonicalization — and a gate that stops at the first one would
 * pass while the trace still wrote null.
