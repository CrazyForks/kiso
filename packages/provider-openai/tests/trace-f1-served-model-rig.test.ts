/**
 * TRACE-F1 — the adapter reads the id the SERVER states, not the one we
 * asked for.
 *
 * This is the gate that would have caught the alias. The bench asked for
 * `deepseek-v4-flash` for four days; the server answered as
 * `deepseek-flash` in every chunk it sent, and the adapter never looked.
 * A rig that serves a DIFFERENT id than the request is the only shape that
 * discriminates: a rig echoing the requested id back would pass on an
 * adapter that simply copies `options.model`, which is the defect.
