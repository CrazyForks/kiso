 * CW-1 (owner, 2026-09-23): "a user can reach the same few models through
 * any provider or baseUrl — changing the baseUrl must not turn ctx into ?".
 *
 * The live case: the owner's `op` profile, `deepseek-v4.1-flash` at a local
 * forwarder (127.0.0.1:47821) to a model gateway. No registry row is keyed by
 * that (model, endpoint), so the status row read `ctx ?` and the tiers
 * compacted a 1M model against the CLI's 200K fallback.
