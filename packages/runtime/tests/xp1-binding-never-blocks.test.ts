/**
 * XP-1 — a CHANGED BINDING never blocks (the owner's ruling of 2026-09-21).
 *
 * The rule before it: `material` drift refused the open unless the caller
 * passed `acceptDrift`, so "I moved to another provider" was an error a
 * resume could not pass at all — and DC-8's grandfather case (an unscoped
 * record meeting a scoped process) drifted on every session recorded
 * before the scope existed.
 *
 * The rule now: the CURRENT configuration wins, DURABLY — the next
 * revision records what will answer the next request — and the session
 * says what changed through `driftAcknowledgement`. Nothing
 * provider-specific crosses the change: every adapter withholds foreign
 * reasoning/continuation (MG-1 A5), so a new binding loses cache state,
 * never correctness.
 *
 * The fail-closed INTEGRITY cases are untouched, and pinned here as the
 * boundary: a sidecar that cannot be read is still BLOCKED, and an XP-era
 * log (scoped envelopes, no sidecar) is still BLOCKED. A ruling about
 * bindings must never become a ruling about integrity.
