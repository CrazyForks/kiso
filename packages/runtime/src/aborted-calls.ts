/**
 * 0.40.2 — a COMMITTED call that never ran, in a run that ended aborted.
 *
 * The finding: an esc that lands after a turn's `stop` committed it (EC-1
 * ①) but before a call's `tool_execution_started` leaves that call's
 * `tool_call_end` on disk with no started, no receipt and no result — the
 * kernel's abort sentinel is swallowed at the launch (no started, no
 * receipt, never uncertain: right for an UNCOMMITTED turn, which the loop
 * abandons whole). The run's terminal is written, so the recovery plan
 * answers TERMINAL and nothing ever completes the call. The projection
 * keeps the `tool_use` without its result, and every later request is a
 * provider 400 — the session is poisoned for good (the owner's session
 * 2026-09-22T01-58-27-0027: three committed shell calls, two results).
 *
 * The cure lives here, in the runtime's recovery, and not in the kernel:
 * when a session opens, each such call gets ONE durable `tool_result` —
 * "aborted before execution", a precondition error, the very result the
 * kernel writes when the same esc lands one step later — riding the run
 * that owns the call. It is idempotent per invocation (a crash between two
 * repairs leaves the rest for the next open), it never writes a started
 * event (that would make the call `uncertain` and ask a human about work
 * that provably never began), and it heals the already-poisoned logs with
 * no migration: the next open repairs them.
