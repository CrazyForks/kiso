/**
 * ADR-0005 Amendment 2 — the backoff, the budget, and a retry you can see.
 *
 * CX-1 F8's `max(n × 250 ms, Retry-After)` with a default budget of 2 spent
 * every retry inside 750 ms: no budget at all against a gateway that drops
 * a stream and comes back. 0.39.1 had just made that failure RETRYABLE,
 * and the kernel then gave it three-quarters of a second.
 *
 * The amendment changes three things, each pinned here:
 *  - the curve: min(500 ms × 2^(n−1), 32 s) + up to 25% jitter, never
 *    below the provider's Retry-After;
 *  - the default budget: 10;
 *  - the retry is ANNOUNCED before each wait (`onRetry`), because a budget
 *    measured in minutes with nothing on screen is indistinguishable from
 *    a hung session.
