/**
 * WR-1E2 — the multi-hunk transactional edit (the frozen RED matrix).
 *
 * The law is unchanged: an existing-file mutation cites an observed
 * content state; the state is checked before effect and revalidated
 * before publish. What changes is the SHAPE: one expectedRevision, N
 * disjoint hunks, one postimage, one atomic publish, one new token.
 *
 * Hunk semantics (P0, frozen before GREEN; ACI-3 supersedes the first
 * sentence): every hunk resolves against the SAME snapshot
 * expectedRevision validated — never against earlier hunks' output.
 * Since ACI-3 the hunks apply IN ORDER, each against the result of the
 * ones before it, still all or nothing. Exactly-once literal match per hunk (ACI-2); all
 * spans determined before staging; overlaps refuse (duplicate searches
 * both resolve to that same one place and therefore overlap — never silently
 * retargeted). Shape errors (mixed forms, empty, >32) are
 * invalid_input; world errors (missing pattern, stale) are
 * precondition. No partial postimage is ever published.
